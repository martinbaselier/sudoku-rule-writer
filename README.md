# sudoku-rule-writer

This tool has been created to make the task of adding rules to a sudoku easier. It contains most common rules for variation sudoku. I will slowly extend this. Since I can be quite punctilious about the wording, they might change between versions. It has been tested with firefox and chromium. 

Clues are grouped by type. Within a group, clues are ordered alphabetically. The following groups were used: main , global, outside, lines, other and neighbours

You can download the source and run it on you own pc or use it direcyly online at https://martinbaselier.github.io/sudoku-rule-writer/

Feel free to modify it and adapt it for your own use. Just add your rules to rules.js and they should appear. It should be pretty much self-explanatory.
